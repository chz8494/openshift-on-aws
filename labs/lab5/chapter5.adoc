# OpenShift templates and web console

In this lab we introduce how to simplify your container deployments with OpenShift templates.  We will also explore the web console.

This lab should be performed on **YOUR ASSIGNED AWS VM** as `ec2-user` unless otherwise instructed.

Expected completion: 20 minutes

## Project preparation

Step 1:: Login to our local OpenShift.
----
$ oc login -u developer
You have one project on this server: "myproject"
----

You are now logged in to OpenShift and are using the ```devel``` project. You can also view the OpenShift web console by using the same credentials to log in to ```https://<YOUR AWS VM PUBLIC DNS NAME HERE>:8443``` in a browser.


Step 2:: Let's create a new project:
----
$ oc new-project production
Now using project "devel" on server "https://127.0.0.1:8443".
----


## Wordpress templated deployment

During the setup phase a wordpress and mariadb container were build and pushed to a local container repo running on port 5000.
A template will be used to deploy these to OpenShift.

Feel free to view the full template.
----
$ cd ~/summit-2018-container-lab/labs/lab5/
$ grep localhost:5000 wordpress-template.yaml
----

You will note the application spec containing all the appliction details as well as the image being pulled from the local container repo.

Step 3:: Let's deploy this wordpress template by adding your template to the production project
----
$ oc create -f wordpress-template.yaml
template "wordpress" created
----

Step 4:: Deploy your new template with "oc new-app" and note its output
----
$ oc new-app --template wordpress
--> Deploying template "production/wordpress" to project production
----

Step 5:: View all of the newly created resources
----
$ oc get all
----

You can confirm the state of the application roll out:

----
$ oc rollout status -w dc/mariadb
$ oc rollout status -w dc/wordpress
----

You should see something like:
----
replication controller "mariadb-1" successfully rolled out
replication controller "wordpress-1" successfully rolled out
----

Step 6: Verify the database started
----
$ oc logs dc/mariadb
----

expected output: mysqld_safe Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /var/lib/mysql

Step 7:: Verify wordpress started
----
$ oc logs dc/wordpress
----

Expected outpiut: /usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND

Step 8:: view of how these resources connect using oc status
----
$ oc status
----

Step 9:: Check and make sure you can access the wordpress service through it's route:
----
$ oc get routes
$ curl -L wordpress-production.<YOUR AWS VM PUBLIC IP>.nip.io
----

* Or open the URL in a browser to view the UI

OpenShift includes several ready-made templates. Let's take a look at some of them:
----
$ oc get templates -n openshift
----

For more information on templates, reference the official OpenShift documentation:

## Web console

Now that we have deployed our template, let’s login as developer to the OpenShift web console - `https://<YOUR AWS VM PUBLIC DNS NAME HERE>:8443`

Step 10:: Get OpenShift console URL:
----
$ oc cluster status
----

Login to the web console with the `developer` user.

And after we’ve logged in, we see a list of projects that the developer user has access to. Let's select the `production` project:

Our project landing page provides us with a high-level overview of our wordpress application's pods, services, and route:

Let's dive a little deeper. We want to view a list of our pods by clicking on `Pods` in the left Applications menu:

Next, let's click on one of our running pods for greater detail:

With this view, we have access to pod information like status, logs, image, volumes, and more:

Feel free to continue exploring the console.

In the final lab you'll get to play with some new features, the service catalog and broker.
